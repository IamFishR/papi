Of course, here is a completed, concise trading plan based on your structure. It is designed to be printed.

### **Daily Trading Plan**

#### **Core Rules**
* **Entry:** Enter only when your pre-defined strategy gives a clear signal (e.g., a bullish candle pattern forming above the 20-period moving average). Do not enter on impulse.
* **Exit:** Exit the trade when your profit target is hit or your stop loss is triggered. No exceptions.
* **Profit Take:** Define a target based on a Risk-to-Reward ratio of at least 1:2 (e.g., if you risk ₹200, your target should be at least ₹400).
* **Stop Loss:** Always trade with a stop loss. Set it at a level that invalidates your trade idea (e.g., below the recent swing low for a long trade). Never risk more than 1-2% of your total capital (₹400 - ₹800 on a ₹40,000 account) on a single trade.
    * **Trailing Stop:** Use a trailing stop loss to protect profits once the trade is significantly in your favor.
* **Trading Journal:** After each trading day, log your trades. Record: Entry Price, Exit Price, Reason for Trade, Profit/Loss, and Lessons Learned.
* **Risk Management:** Your primary job is to manage risk. Before entering any trade, you must know exactly how much you are willing to lose.
* **Position Sizing:** Calculate the number of shares per trade based on your risk.
    * **Formula:** `Shares = (Total Capital * Risk %) / (Entry Price - Stop Loss Price)`

#### **Identifying the Trading Opportunity**
* **High Liquidity:** Ensures you can buy and sell easily without major price slippage.
* **Volatility:** The stock must move enough to provide profit opportunities.
* **Market/Sector Trends:** Trade in the direction of the overall market (Nifty/Sensex) and the stock's sector trend. Don't fight the tape.
* **News Events:** Be aware of major news, as it can act as a powerful catalyst for price movement.
* **Technical Indicators:** Use a combination of 2-3 indicators to confirm your trade idea. For example:
    * **Trend:** 20 & 50 Period Moving Averages (MA).
    * **Momentum:** Relative Strength Index (RSI).
    * **Entry Signal:** Candlestick Patterns (e.g., Engulfing, Hammer).
* **Fundamental Analysis:** For intraday, this is less critical, but focus on fundamentally sound companies to avoid trading in poor-quality stocks.
